Wife wanted asked me to digitize a cookbook, so I scanned the pages and saved them as pdf. 

Wife said thanks but I need to be able to search the text for the recipe names and ingredients. 

This does that. 

Note: replace the part after "pdf_path =" with the location of your file. And you'll need to install pytesseract and pdf2image and a few other libraries.
