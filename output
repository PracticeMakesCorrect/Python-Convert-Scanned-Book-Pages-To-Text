MAKES 2 PRESERVED LEMONS.

2 lemons, scrubbed clean and
sliced % inch thick

2 tablespoons kosher salt

1. Bring a large pot of water
to a boil over high heat. Add
an 8-ounce glass jar and its lid
and boil for 10 minutes. Use
tongs to carefully remove the
jar and lid and allow them to
steam dry while you start the
lemons.

2. Inthe same pot, bring

6 cups of water to a boil
over high heat. Add the
lemon slices and reduce the
heat to medium. Simmer
for [5 minutes; you want the
rinds to be soft.

3. Tightly seal the jar and store
at room temperature for up to
3 days, then store in the fridge
for up to 3 months. Be sure to
rinse the lemons to remove
some of the salt before using
them.

3. Drain the lemons and

allow them to steam dry in the
colander or sieve. Transfer the
lemons to a large bowl and toss
with the salt. Layer the salted
lemons in the sterilized jar,
giving them a gentle nudge so
they all fit. (Smooshing them

a bit so they release some of
their juices is not a bad thing.)

4. Tightly seal the jar and
store at room temperature.
You can use the lemons after
30 minutes, but | recommend
waiting at least 3 hours.

5. Store the lemons at room
temperature for up to 3 days,
then store in the fridge for up
to 3 months. Be sure to rinse
the lemons to remove some of
the salt before using them.
